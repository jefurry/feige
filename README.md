# feige
Feige based on golang and lua(gopher-lua: https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua). it is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems. https://www.feige.io/
